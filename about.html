							<h6>Career</h6>
							<p>I am a Designer with a background in software, research and data. I am interested in accessibility and breaking down institutional barriers through design. I believe that Design Thinking can be applied to everything in life, and engineers and designers should incorporate knowledge from both fields. I am interested in work that involves utilizing tools from multiple different spaces and the human side of the tech industry. I graduated from the University of California San Diego with a degree in Cognitive Science, specializing in Design & Interaction. Currently looking for work in Software Development and UX Design.</p>
							<p>Most recently, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern in IBM Cloud Austin. I worked in the Softlayer team on the Internal Management System, a service for managing cloud deployment.
							<p>I am particularly proud of my work designing a <a href="./files/report.pdf">Makerspace</a> for local usage in Myanmar with Atutu, a San Diego based NGO, and designing the web app and product for <a href="https://github.com/cwguan/accounta-buddy">AccountaBuddy</a>, a proof-of-concept web app that gamifies accountability and positive habit formation.</P>
							<p>I have a solid background in leadership and management, having previously been an Orientation Leader for UC San Diego's Sixth College, an admin of the UCSD Dota 2 Discord server, and the team captain of UCSD's Division 1 Dota 2 team.</p>
